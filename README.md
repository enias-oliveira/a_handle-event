**Note:** You should have already finished [Lesson: Object Oriented Programming](https://my.kenzie.academy/courses/20/assignments/1617 "Lesson: Object Oriented Programming") before beginning this activity.

In a number of previous projects, you have written functions to use as Event Listeners for "click" and "keypress" events. Today you will learn how to use an Object as an Event Listener by implementing the handleEvent method.

**First**, take a look at the [MDN EventListener documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) for a small example.

**Next**, fork a copy of the repository at [https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se/fe/code-quality/a_handle-event](https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se/fe/code-quality/a_handle-event)

The code implemented so far will show 5 seedlings on the screen.

Follow the instructions in the TODO comment within the js file. They will direct you to implement a handleEvent method inside the ClickToAdvance object. If you complete this, you will be able to click on the seedlings to make them grow.

Here is an example of how the page should behave after you have completed the handleEvent method:
